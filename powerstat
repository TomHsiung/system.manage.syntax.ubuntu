NAME
       powerstat - a tool to measure power consumption

SYNOPSIS
       powerstat [options] [delay [count]]

DESCRIPTION
       powerstat  measures the power consumption of a computer that has a bat‚Äê
       tery power source or supports the RAPL (Running  Average  Power  Limit)
       interface.   The output is like vmstat but also shows power consumption
       statistics.  At the end of a run, powerstat will calculate the average,
       standard  deviation, minimum, maximum and geometic mean of the gathered
       data.

       Note that running powerstat as  root  will  provide  extra  information
       about process fork(2), exec(2) and exit(2) activity.

# Examples,
powerstat -R -c -z
