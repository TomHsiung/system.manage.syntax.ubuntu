# Axel  is  a  program  that  downloads  a  file  from a FTP or HTTP server through multiple
#       connection, each connection downloads its own part of the file.
#
#       Unlike most other programs, Axel downloads all the data directly to the destination  file,
#       using  one  single  thread. It just saves some time at the end because the program doesn't
#       have to concatenate all the downloaded parts.

axel --num-connections=5 --alternate -o /path/to/download/ https://static.emulatorgames.net/roms/mame/mslug6.zip

# One argument is required, the URL to the file you want to download. When downloading  from
#       FTP,  the  filename  may  contain  wildcards  and the program will try to resolve the full
#       filename. Multiple URL's can be specified as well and the program will use all those URL's
#       for the download. Please note that the program does not check whether the files are equal.
#
#       Other options:
#
#       --max-speed=x, -s x
#              You  can  specify  a  speed  (bytes  per second) here and Axel will try to keep the
#              average speed around this speed. Useful if you don't want the program  to  suck  up
#              all of your bandwidth.
#
#       --num-connections=x, -n x
#              You can specify an alternative number of connections here.
#
#       --output=x, -o x
#              Downloaded  data will be put in a local file with the same name, unless you specify
#              a different name using this option. You  can  specify  a  directory  as  well,  the
#              program will append the filename.
#
#       --search[=x], -S[x]
#              Axel  can  do  a search for mirrors using the filesearching.com search engine. This
#              search will be done if you use this option. You  can  specify  how  many  different
#              mirrors should be used for the download as well.
#
#              The  search  for  mirrors  can  be  time-consuming  because the program tests every
#              server's speed, and it checks whether the file's still available.
#
#       --no-proxy, -N
#              Don't use any proxy server to download the file. Not possible  when  a  transparent
#              proxy is active somewhere, of course.
#
#       --verbose
#              If  you want to see more status messages, you can use this option. Use it more than
#              once if you want to see more.
#
#       --quiet, -q
#              No output to stdout.
#
#       --alternate, -a
#              This will show an alternate progress indicator. A bar  displays  the  progress  and
#              status  of  the different threads, along with current speed and an estimate for the
#              remaining download time.
#
#       --header=x, -H x
#              Add an additional HTTP header. This option should be in the form  "Header:  Value".
#              See RFC 2616 section 4.2 and 14 for details on the format and standardized headers.
#
#       --user-agent=x, -U x
#              Set  the  HTTP  user agent to use. Some websites serve different content based upon
#              this parameter. The  default  value  will  include  "Axel",  its  version  and  the
#              platform.
#
#       --help, -h
#              A brief summary of all the options.
#
#       --version, -V
#              Get version information.
